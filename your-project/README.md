## Project DescriptionC
The project is about the game  "Guess the number". I'll choose it would be fun to code.
## Rules
The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range (in our case the machine) while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!”

## Workflow
1. The machine will print "Let's start!. Guess the number to win the prize! You have 3 attemps!"
2. The machine will choose a random number form 1 to 15.
3. It will ask the user to type an integer from 1 to 15.
4. If the user enter a diferent number or any other type of value, it will ask the user to enter a number between 1 to 15.
5. Once the user types a number that match our requirements, it will compare that number with the one the machine chose. There will be three possible reponses:
    5.1 - The number chosen by the user is higher: if this happen, the machine will print "Your number is higher than the one I chose, you have two attends left!!". 
    5.2 - The number chosen by the user is lower: if this happen, the machine will print "Your number is higher than the one I chose, you still have one more opportunity!!".And the user will have just 2 more attends to guess it.
    5.3 - The user guessed the number. It will print "YAY!! you won a special prize!!!""
6. The game will continue till either the person guesses the number or the numbers of attempts left is 0.


## Organization
I have used Trello.

It has a README document with information about what you will find in the main document. And a main document with the code.
